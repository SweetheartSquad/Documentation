\section{Generative Audio}
The soundtrack for \ourgame{} will feature a number of original upbeat dance tracks and thumping rock songs to match the party theme. Additionally, various sound effects will be created for different aspects of \ourgame{}. Navigational sound effects such as footsteps, doors opening, and collisions will be added to enhance the atmosphere of the game. Sound effects will also be created to increase the excitement of the DISS battles. These will include audience sound effects such as cheering and failure sound effects for the player's actions. 

\subsection{Generative Speech}
As \ourteam{} plans to include a prohibitively large amount of written content, full voice-overs will not be possible. Instead, \ourgame{} will implement a generative audio system in order to simulate speech. Characters will be randomly assigned an individual voice sample which will be the basis for all of their audio. The audio system will detect the letters used when a character is speaking and convert the ASCII character code into a pitch shift applied to their voice sample. In addition to automatically providing audio for written content, using this system will allow \ourteam{} to generate aspects of the character dialogue without sacrificing the audio component.
