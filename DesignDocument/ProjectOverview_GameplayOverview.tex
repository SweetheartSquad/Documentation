\section{Gameplay Overview}
\ourgame{} is a first person adventure game in which the player explores a 3D world populated by strange 2D characters. In the game, the player may interact with these characters by talking to them, befriending them, or dissing them out. By talking to characters, the player can unlock quests, learn more about different guests at the party, and discover more information concerning the main plot of the game. By completing quests, the player can improve their friendship rating with a non-player character and eventually call them a friend. Doing this will allow the player to progress further in the game, as well as aid them when dissing their foes. During DISS battles, users will have to insult enemies and interject enemy insults, with their success relying on their personal D.I.S.S. statistics: Defense, Insight, Strength, and Sass. The world will also be populated with interactive 2D elements. Some of these will be items that can be used to solve narrative dilemmas or buff/debuff characters' statistics, and others are interactive environmental objects.

The game will be broken up into multiple sessions: for each session, the goal is to find the inter-dimensional teleportation device. To do this the player will have to explore Omar Clean's house, uncover secrets, and help fellow party-goers.
