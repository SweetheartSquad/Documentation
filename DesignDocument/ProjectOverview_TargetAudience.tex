\section{Target Audience}
\ourteam{}'s target audience for this project will primarily be of the 18-29 age group. Reports from the PEW research center indicates that high percentages of this demographic are video game players. In most countries, this age group also encompasses university students; there is a good chance that student users will have had party experiences of their own to draw upon while playing \ourgame{}.

\ourgame{} will be a surreal single-player game in a first-person perspective. Games that use this formula, such as \textit{Crypt Worlds}, \textit{Slave of God}, and \textit{Proteus}, have found a dedicated audience by emphasizing exploration and discovery over more traditional game mechanics. \textit{Crypt Worlds} and \textit{Slave of God} have been featured in publications such as PC Gamer, Kill Screen Daily, Rock Paper Shotgun, and IndieGames.com. \textit{Proteus} has been nominated for and won numerous independent game awards, and was recently featured in the 2012 exhibit "Common Senses" at the Museum of Modern Art.

First-person adventure games have not only been successful in the freeware domain, but also have proven to be a commercially and critically successful formula. In February 2014, The Fullbright Company, creators of acclaimed story-rich adventure \textit{Gone Home}, announced that their game had sold over 250,000 copies. The cultural trend that is driving professional and independent developers toward more comedic and experimental forms of interactive storytelling finds inspiration in the past. \textit{Psychonauts} featured an unconventional and humorous story, but was considered a commercial failure at release. Since then, it has developed a large cult following -- as of March 2012, has sold over 400,000 retail copies, not including sales from online platforms such as Steam and GOG.

In order to attract the attention of the target demographic, \ourteam{} will be creating a game that follows this current trend of experimental interactive experiences and provides the audience with unconventional gameplay and humour. Like the games mentioned above, it will appeal to an audience who, frustrated with the restrictive ideals of the big budget game industry, is looking for unique narrative experiences.
