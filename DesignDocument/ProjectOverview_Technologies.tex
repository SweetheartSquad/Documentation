\subsection{S-Tengine2}
\ourengine{} will be used for the development of \ourgame{}. \ourengine{} is an OpenGL-based C++ game engine developed by members of \ourteam{}. Originally developed as a renderer for a directed studies project in the fall term of 2014, development on the engine has continued in the following year and led to the creation of four games. The decision to use \ourengine{} for the development of \ourgame{} was reached for a number of reasons. One of the most significant advantages over popular alternatives such as Unity or UE4 is the nature of the engine's development. The alternatives are pre-existing game engines developed by a specific team who do not allow users to view the source code. \ourengine{}, however, is entirely open source and \ourteam{} is intimately familiar with source code and systems currently in place. This difference becomes hugely important when trying to implement a complex system in the game: by fully understanding the architecture on which the game is built, it is much easier to implement complex features. If a desired feature is not available within a system, then the system itself must be changed. In the case of a closed source, third-party engine, this would be prohibitively difficult, whereas it is easily achievable within the chosen engine. The fact that both \ourengine{} and \ourgame{} are being developed by \ourteam{} also contributes to the decision, as it means that the design philosophies employed during the development of both projects will be the same. This will allow for easier integration with the engine during development, as \ourteam{}'s developers will always be working with the system instead of against it. Additionally, since the engine is written in C++, developers will have low-level control: e.g. C++ does not have a built-in garbage collector, allowing for more controlled memory management. \ourengine{} is also targeted at developers who favour code over a WYSIWYG style system, which matches the development style of \ourteam{}. This will increase productivity during the development process of \ourgame{}.
