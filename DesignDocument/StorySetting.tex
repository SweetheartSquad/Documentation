\section{Characters}

\subsection{Main Characters}
Main characters are characters directly related to the main storyline described in Section~\ref{sec:mainplot}. This includes Goodsee Beauregard, the Protector version of Omar Clean, and the Portrait version of Omar Clean, who are described in more detail in Appendix \ref{app:characters}.

\subsection{Side Characters}
Side characters are characters that are not involved with the main storyline, but are involved in secondary storylines in \ourgame{}. These storylines are small and contained, and they resolve with help from the player. Upon completing these smaller stories, the player gets rewards that may aid them in completing the main storyline. Examples of side characters can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:characters}.

\subsection{Incidental Characters}
Many characters in \ourgame{} are simple party guests with no relation to the main storyline or any side plots. These characters will be procedurally generated using a component structure. Lines of semi-procedurally generated dialogue will be created for each character that will be said when the player interacts with the character. This use of procedural generation allows for the reuse of assets to quickly and uniquely populate each environment with interactive characters, without feeling overly repetitive for the player.
