\section{Side Plots}
Most of the alternate dimensions within \ourgame{} have a particular version of Omar Clean. Each version of Omar Clean has their own desires and issues within their own dimension. The player can choose to help or hinder each Omar in their personal quests. These quests do not change the outcome of the main plot, but serve to endear the player to the multiple Omar Cleans, and to give them a secondary motivation for exploring the many dimensions in the game world. Examples of these secondary Omar Cleans can be found in Appendix \ref{app:characters}. Each run will also include characters who will ask the player to solve certain problems for them in exchanges for items or access to new parts of the mansion. These stories will be small and self-contained. Examples of these secondary plots and the characters involved can be found in Appendix \ref{app:characters}.
