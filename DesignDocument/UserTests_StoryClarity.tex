\section{Story Clarity Test}

The story of \ourgame{} contains many characters and plot points. In order to determine whether the story of \ourgame{} can be clearly understood by players, a user test will be performed. In preparation for the test, the story of \ourgame{} will be printed out. The team member performing the test will read the story to the participant without providing an explanation as to what subsequent steps in the test will entail. Once the team member has finished reading the story, they will ask the participant to repeat it back to them. As the participant repeats the story back, they will be recorded for review by the team. The participant will also be questioned about what parts of the story were unclear or which confused them. If the participant is able to hit all of the major plot points and name the major characters, the test will be considered a success. If the participant is unable to do so, the test will be considered a failure. If a significant number of participants fail the test, then changes to the story will be made according to participant feedback. Once the revisions to the story have been made, the test will be repeated. For objective data, the percentage of users who fail the test will be calculated.
