\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Overview}

The topic of interest for this project is Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, commonly known as ASMR, which is a \inlinequote{sensory phenomenon, in which individuals experience a tingling, static-like sensation across the scalp, back of the neck and at times further areas in response to specific triggering audio and visual stimuli}~\cite{barratt2015autonomous}. Although ASMR can occur as a result of virtually any stimulus, there is an emerging trend of ASMR content uploaded to YouTube, with one of the most popular channels garnering nearly 200 million views since their first video was uploaded four years ago~\cite{anon.gentlewhispering}. These videos are meant to lull viewers into relaxed states by incorporating specific audio stimuli, including whispering, tapping, brushing, and other sounds, ideally recorded using binaural microphones for increased immersion.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/google-trends}
  \caption{The popularity of ASMR searches has been rising steadily over the past four years. Data Source: Google Trends (\url{www.google.com/trends/}).}~\label{fig:google-trends}
\end{figure}

We plan to explore whether the immersion, presence, and/or interactivity of a virtual reality system affects viewers' experience with media designed to evoke ASMR. This exploration will be achieved through the use of a custom-developed ASMR experience, an Oculus Rift\footnote{DK2 headset}, and a pair of high quality headphones\footnote{Grado SR80e headphones}.

The ASMR experience that we intend to create is one wherein the participant's avatar receives a virtual salon makeover. It will consist of a makeup artist, shown in proxy as a roughly animated character silhouette, applying makeup to the participant's avatar. True to the format of ASMR videos, the artist will move around and speak as they go about their tasks. The artist's speech will be a pre-recorded mono track and positional audio will be used to place it relative to the participant.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/layout}
  \caption{Mockup of the salon layout and the makeup artist's motion path.}~\label{fig:layout}
\end{figure}

At certain points, the artist will offer participants a selection of products. A selection can be made by through head-tracking: by maintaining eye contact with the choice for a set time (see
Figure~\ref{fig:selection}). Choices made will cosmetically affect the avatar displayed at the experience's conclusion.

\begin{figure}[htb]

  \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/selection}
  \caption{Mockup of the selection method which uses the center of the screen as a cursor position.}~\label{fig:selection}
\end{figure}

\subsection{User Study}

To evaluate the experience, a comparative study will be performed in which participants are exposed to two variations of the experience: one will be the VR experience exactly as developed, and the other will lack visual stimuli and interaction in order to isolate audio, the component most closely associated with the YouTube ASMR format\footnote{During interactive elements in which a question is posed to the participant, the audio will continue without any user input. Both versions will include some questions in this format (e.g. \inlinequote{How was your day?}) to avoid interference with study results.}. The test will use a within-subjects design, as individual differences would be a significant source of error for something as subjective as ASMR.

We hypothesize that the addition of visual stimuli and interaction with the system will further immerse the participant in the ASMR experience. As 98\% of individuals searching for ASMR videos have indicated that they do so for relaxation~\cite{barratt2015autonomous}, we will be evaluating the participant's sense of relaxation. This will be measured through surveys and possible physiological indicators (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate) during or after the experience. We expect to observe higher satisfaction with the experience as a result of these factors than with passive audio alone. We believe this will open up the ASMR video-producing community to a new form of experience unlike those found on YouTube.

\subsection{Future Work}

A possible extension of this experience would be to have the test administrator brush the participant's face with actual makeup brushes in-sync with the virtual brushes. As we intend to primarily evaluate the visual and interactive elements, this idea was excluded from this proposal. We hypothesize that this haptic stimuli on its own could be capable of eliciting sensations similar to ASMR (which would interfere with our study)~\cite{hall1897psychology}, and so we leave this for future works to consider.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Introduction to Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response}
Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR, is the tingling sensation across the scalp and back of the neck, caused by specific audio and visual stimuli~\cite{barratt2015autonomous}. To experience ASMR, many users watch videos, often involving personal attention or grooming role-play \cite{andersen2015now,barratt2015autonomous} with a female host~\cite{andersen2015now} designed to elicit the phenomenon. Various types of stimuli can be used within a video to evoke the desired response~\cite{barratt2015autonomous}. When surveying those that experienced ASMR in order to learn which stimuli was triggering, it was found that whispering, personal attention, crisp sounds, and slow movements could cause the response. Whispering was the most common among participants, affecting 75\% \cite{barratt2015autonomous}. To increase the sensation, users may change their environment by dimming the lights or using headphones~\cite{begman2015}. For our project, we will be recording similar audio stimuli to those listed above, and utilizing high-fidelity headphones for the best experience. Since an HMD will be used, dimming the lights is unnecessary.

Apart from eliciting a tingling sensation, ASMR is able to put users into a state similar to flow state, \inlinequote{the state of intense focus and diminished awareness of the passage of time that is often associated with optimal performance}~\cite{barratt2015autonomous}. During their research, Barratt and Davis observed that this state of concentration was improved with more ASMR triggers~\cite{barratt2015autonomous}. ASMR is valued for its calming effects \cite{barratt2015autonomous}; polls indicated that 98\% of users view ASMR videos for relaxation, and 70\% for stress relief~\cite{barratt2015autonomous}. Some believe in its effects enough to promote ASMR as a treatment for stress-related conditions such as anxiety~\cite{andersen2015now,begman2015}.

Unfortunately for those who use ASMR, these effects can be lost over long-time usage~\cite{andersen2015now}. In this situation, users often turn to more immersive experiences that use binaural sound and 3D microphones~\cite{andersen2015now}. It is believed that this adds to the experience's intimacy, heightening the response~\cite{andersen2015now}. We hope to determine whether the increased level of immersion of our choice of display will amplify the sensations provided by ASMR.

\subsection{Virtual Reality Input Methods}
In a 2008 study, when comparing mouse and gaze pointing methods, participants perceived gaze as faster but less accurate than mouse pointing~\cite{mateo2008gaze}. Discomfort is a drawback of gaze pointing, especially if users must keep their heads still for a long time~\cite{mateo2008gaze}. We believe that the gaze method will work well for our project, as users will not be asked to complete tasks requiring accuracy or holding a position for a long time.

\subsection{The Effects of Virtual Reality}
Like real life environments, virtual environments can cause emotional reactions. During a 2007 experiment, it was found that when placed into a relaxation- or anxiety-inducing environment, participants showed signs of either relaxation or anxiety~\cite{riva2007affective}. It was also shown that a relaxing VR experience can increase feelings of quietness and happiness while reducing anger, sadness and anxiety~\cite{riva2007affective}. This suggests that virtual environments can be designed to evoke an emotional response from users~\cite{riva2007affective,wiederhold2006evaluation}. 
It was also found that the level of presence\footnote{\inlinequote{the \inlinequote{sense of being there} or the \inlinequote{feeling of being in a world that exists outside the self.}}~\cite{riva2007affective}} felt by participants was greater in relaxing and anxious environments than in neutral ones, and that the greatest feeling of presence was achieved in the relaxing environment~\cite{riva2007affective}. A previous review of virtual environments found that a participant's sense of presence is influenced by the attributes of the VR platform, the features of the environment itself, and the individuals characteristics~\cite{nash2000review}.

VR has also been seen as an alternative to therapy administration, which could help people in overcoming anxiety and stress-related conditions. It has been found in various studies that individuals enjoy VR therapy more than traditional therapy, leading to an increase in motivation to complete treatment~\cite{kizony2003adapting,morel2015advantages}. VR therapy also has the benefit of current equipment being affordable, allowing participants to engage in sessions in their own homes~\cite{morel2015advantages}. When researching the viability of VR therapy, a follow-up survey of those who suffered from anxiety found that there was no significant difference in the level of anxiety felt between participants of VR and traditional therapy~\cite{safir2011virtual}.

VR and ASMR have the shared capability of inducing relaxation and are both often used for therapeutic purposes. We hope that by combining these two relaxing mediums, users will be able to achieve a higher level of presence, which will increase the perception of intimacy ASMR users desire, leading to an increase in its effects.

\subsection{Testing Methods}
To collect data on subjective topics, questionnaires are a useful tool. During Riva's experiment on the link between presence and emotions in multiple virtual environments, questionnaires were used to evaluate mood before and after the experience including Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The VAS required participants to indicate how they feel at a specific moment in time regarding their level of happiness, anger, surprise, disgust, anxiety and quietness. The PANAS uses a list of 20 adjectives that describe 10 positive and 10 negative emotions which can be viewed in Appendix~\ref{Appendix_A}. Participants must associate a magnitude on a scale of 1-5 for each emotion at a given moment. The STAI measures the level of anxiety participants feel on a scale of 0-3. The \inlinequote{State} version of this questionnaire asks participants how they feel at a given moment, while the \inlinequote{Trait} version asks for their general feelings. These questionnaires were provided to participants before and after testing to compare their baseline emotional state against the effects of the environment. Two additional questionnaires, the UCL Presence Questionnaire, and the Independent Television Company Sense of Presence Inventory (ITC-SOPI) were also given to participants after each stage in order to assess their presence. For the UCL Presence Questionnaire, please see Appendix~\ref{Appendix_A}.
The ITC-SOPI was used to measure different dimensions of presence, such as sense of physical space, engagement, ecological validity, and negative effects. The questionnaire is divided into two parts. The first consists of six items used to measure a participant's experience after the test has concluded, and the second consists of 38 items used to measure the participants experience during the test. Each is scored using a 5-point Likert scale~\cite{riva2007affective}.

Riva and her team also asked participants questions rated using a 10-point scale, while they were within the virtual environment. To measure their emotional status, participants were asked to what extent they felt sad, happy, anxious, and relaxed at any given moment. To measure presence, participants were asked if they felt as if they were in the virtual environment and whether that environment was a real place they were visiting. To view these questions, please see Appendix~\ref{Appendix_A}.
To reduce errors as a result of their within-subjects design, every participant was required to test each environment, with the sequence of environments being randomized~\cite{riva2007affective}.

For objective measurements on the emotional state of participants, physiological measures, such as heart-rate, can be taken. During a 2006 study on the effects of relaxation techniques and heart rate variability, it was found that guided relaxation decreased the participant's heart rate~\cite{sarang2006effects}. This shows a correlation between an individual's level of relaxation, which cannot directly be measured, and their heart rate.

To gather information on \inlinequote{the prevalence of particular features of ASMR, when and why individuals engage in ASMR, and the relation of ASMR to other known phenomenon}, Barratt and Davis collected information on a participant's viewing habits and various facets of their experience using a questionnaire~\cite{barratt2015autonomous}. Although this questionnaire is designed for use with those already familiar with ASMR, it could likely be used to assess the experiences of individuals new to the phenomenon. A version of the original questionnaire can be found in Appendix~\ref{Appendix_A}. 



\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Participants}
The experiment was completed by 10 participants. The average age was 21.67 years old with a standard deviation of 1.41. Of the 10 participants, 6 were male, 3 were female, and 1 identifies as another gender. All of the participants except for 1 had previous experience using VR. Three participants had previously experienced ASMR, listing their triggers as whispering and personal attention, whispering and crisp sounds, and crisp sounds respectively. None of the participants indicated that they watch ASMR videos in their daily life.

Of the 10 participants, one was excluded from the study as they indicated they had a history of heart problems in the family and suffered from a heart condition.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
Participants were read a script, included in the Appendix, that informed them about the ASMR phenomenon, as well as the procedure they would have to follow during the test. They completed a pre-screening questionnaire to provide background information that may affect the test, and were asked to sign a consent form.

Participants were then asked to complete the two procedures outlined below. The order of these tests was alternated between participants to account for any confounding variables caused by completing tests in the same order.

The experiment took an average of 20 minutes to complete per participant.
